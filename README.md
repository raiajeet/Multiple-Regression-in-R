This project involves the implementation of a linear regression model to predict two target variables: Y1(median household income in the county) and Y2(unemployment rate in the county), using a common set of predictors. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, including missing value imputation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and distribution. Stepwise feature selection was employed to identify the most relevant predictors. Based on the selected features, a baseline linear regression model was constructed using only main effects. Following diagnostic checks, the model was improved by incorporating two-way interaction terms, resulting in better performance. Model evaluation was carried out using R-squared (R²), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The complete R code used in this analysis is included in the appendix. Since the distributions of Y1 and Y2 are similar, the same code can be reused for both targets by simply replacing the dependent variable.
